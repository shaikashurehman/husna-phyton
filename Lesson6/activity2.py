# 1) Ask the user to enter their height in centimeters and store it in `height`.

# 2) Ask the user to enter their weight in kilograms and store it in `weight`.

# 3) Calculate BMI using the formula:

# BMI = weight ÷ (height in meters)²

# (Convert height from cm to meters by dividing by 100.)

# Store the result in `BMI`.
height=float(input("enter ur height"))
weight=float(input("enter ur weight"))
BMI = weight / (height/100)**2

# 4) Print the BMI value.

# 5) Use if–elif–else to decide the BMI category:
print("BMI:",BMI)
# - If BMI is 18.4 or less → print "underweight"

# - Else if BMI is 24.9 or less → print "healthy"

# - Else if BMI is 29.9 or less → print "over weight"

# - Else if BMI is 34.9 or less → print "severely over weight"

# - Else if BMI is 39.9 or less → print "obese"

# - Else → print "severely obese"
if BMI<=18.4:
    print("u are under weight")
elif BMI<=24.9:
    print("u are healthy")
elif BMI <= 29.9:

    print("You are over weight.")

elif BMI <= 34.9:

    print("You are severely over weight.")

elif BMI <= 39.9:

    print("You are obese.")

else:

    print("You are severely obese.")
