# 1) Ask the user to enter a word and store it in `string`.
word="Robot"
# 2) Ask the user to enter a single character and store it in `char`.
char='o'
# 3) Set `i` to 0.
i=0
# (This will be used as the index to move through the string.)

# 4) Set `count` to 0.
count=0
# (This will store how many times `char` appears.)

# 5) While `i` is less than the length of `string`:
while(i<len(word)):
    if(word[i]==char):
        count=count+1
    i=i+1
# a) Check if the character at position `i` in `string` is equal to `char`.

# b) If yes, increase `count` by 1.

# c) Increase `i` by 1 to move to the next character.

# 6) After the loop, print how many times `char` occurred in `string` using `count`.
print("the total number of times",char,"as occured",count)
